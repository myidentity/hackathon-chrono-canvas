## Implementation Details

### Shape Color/Fill Controls
- Added Stroke Color picker to property panel for shape elements
- Added Fill Color picker to property panel for shape elements
- Reused existing ColorPicker component for consistent UI
- Ensured dynamic rendering based on element type
- Verified live updates from property panel to canvas

### Testing Results
- Confirmed color/fill controls appear only for shape elements
- Verified z-index controls work for all element types
- Validated that custom properties appear for appropriate element types
- Ensured no regressions in existing property panel functionality

### Notes
- Default stroke color: #333333
- Default fill color: transparent
- Color pickers include preset colors and custom color input
- All changes in the property panel immediately update the canvas
